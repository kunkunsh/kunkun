# Kunkun Custom UI Extension Template (React)

[Custom UI Extension Documentation](https://docs.kunkun.sh/extensions/custom-ui-ext/)

This is a template for a custom UI extension.

This type of extension is basically a static website. You can use any frontend framework you like, this template uses [React](https://react.dev/).

It is assumed that you have some knowledge of frontend development with React.

## Development

Development is the same as developing a normal website.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

- To develop and preview the extension in Kunkun, you need to run the `Add Dev Extension` command in Kunkun, and register this extension's path.

In `package.json`, `"devMain"` is the url for development server, and `"main"` is the path to static `.html` file for production.

To load the extension in development mode, you have to enable it with `Toggle Dev Extension Live Load Mode` command in Kunkun. A `Live` badge will be shown on the commands. This indicates that dev extensions will be loaded from `devMain` instead of `main`.

## Advanced

### Multi-Command

To support multiple commands, you will need multiple `.html` files as entrypoints, and register each command in `package.json`.
It is recommended to use a meta-framework and build with SSG rendering mode, which comes with routing and will output multiple `.html` files.
Kunkun provides meta-framework templates for Nuxt, Next, SvelteKit.

## Verify Build and Publish

```bash
pnpm build # make sure the build npm script works
npx kksh@latest verify # Verify some basic settings before publishing
```

It is recommended to build the extension with the same environment our CI uses.

The docker image used by our CI is `huakunshen/kunkun-ext-builder:latest`.

You can use the following command to build the extension with the same environment our CI uses.
This requires you to have docker installed, and the shell you are using has access to it via `docker` command.

```bash
npx kksh@latest build # Build the extension with
```

`pnpm` is used to install dependencies and build the extension.

The docker image environment also has `node`, `pnpm`, `npm`, `bun`, `deno` installed.
If your build failed, try debug with `huakunshen/kunkun-ext-builder:latest` image in interative mode and bind your extension volume to `/workspace`.

After build successfully, you should find a tarball file ends with `.tgz` in the root of your extension.
The tarball is packaged with `npm pack` command. You can uncompress it to see if it contains all the necessary files.

This tarball is the final product that will be published and installed in Kunkun. You can further verify your extension by installing this tarball directly in Kunkun.

After verifying the tarball, it's ready to be published.

Fork [KunkunExtensions](https://github.com/kunkunsh/KunkunExtensions) repo, add your extension to the `extensions` directory, and create a PR.

Once CI passed and PR merged, you can use your extension in Kunkun.
